A "pfft.. I could toats do that for you in 5 minutes" kind of project (that naturally took hours of PyInstaller debugging).

What is this?
-------------

Destructively resizes a buncha images in the specified directory.

Should I use it?
----------------

Probably not, no.

Then why is it here?
--------------------

Ended up being a decent 'real world', start-to-finish example for packaging up a [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) project that leverages the multiprocessing libs


Hm.. I wanna try it
-------------------

Use the binary here, or clone the project and run `pyinstaller build.spec` from the root directory
